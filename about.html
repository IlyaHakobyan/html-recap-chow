                <p>The Chow Chow, among the world’s most singular and possibly oldest breeds, is depicted in artifacts of China’s Han Dynasty (c. 206 b.c.), but evidence suggests Chows go back much further and are progenitors of other spitz-type breeds—from the burly Norwegian Elkhound to the dainty Pomeranian.</p>

            <h2>Traits</h2>
            <h5>General Appearance</h5>
            <p>The Chow Chow is a compact, stout breed with a large head and a short, deep muzzle. Small, pointed ears and deep-set eyes make it appear as though the breed is scowling. The long fur and a "mane" around the neck earned the Chow Chow the nickname "lion dog."</p>
            <h5>Coat and Coloring</h5>
            <p>Chow Chows have two separate coat types: rough and smooth. Both are densely double-coated. But the rough coat's fur is straight and coarse with a thick, wooly undercoat. The smooth coat is, well, smooth and has an undercoat but no obvious "ruff" on the legs or tail.
                The breed standard includes five colors: red, black, blue, cinnamon, and cream. In red Chow Chows, the shade ranges from light golden to deep mahogany. Cinnamon Chow Chows vary from light fawn to deep cinnamon.</p>
